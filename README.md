**Object Detection Model and Robotic Hand Application with TFLite Model**

**Overview**

This project uses the TFLite Model Maker library to develop an object detection model using the EfficientDet Lite 2 architecture. The model is trained to detect objects of class 'BIG', 'Medium', and 'Small' using a webcam feed. The model is deployed on a robotic hand, which can detect objects in real-time and perform actions accordingly.

**Components**

* **Object Detection Model**: An object detection model trained using the EfficientDet Lite 2 architecture and the TFLite Model Maker library. The model is capable of detecting objects of class 'BIG', 'Medium', and 'Small'.
* **Robotic Hand**: A robotic hand equipped with a webcam and a serial communication interface. The robotic hand uses the object detection model to detect objects in real-time and perform actions accordingly.
* **Webcam Feed**: The webcam feed is used to capture video frames, which are then processed by the object detection model to detect objects.

**Usage**

To use the object detection model and robotic hand application, follow these steps:

1. Connect the robotic hand to a computer using a USB cable.
2. Open the Python script and select the serial port to which the robotic hand is connected using the dropdown menu.
3. Click the "Connect" button to establish a connection with the robotic hand.
4. The object detection model will start processing the webcam feed and detecting objects in real-time.
5. To read data from the robotic hand, use the `read_from_port()` function.
6. To send data to the robotic hand, use the `write_to_port()` function.

**Code Organization**

The code is organized into the following files:

* `pkg.py`: Contains the object detection model code using TFLite Model Maker.
* `train_model.ipynb`: Due to compatibility issues with the latest Python version, the pkg.py file was executed within this Jupyter Notebook. This notebook provides a detailed environment for running the model training process using TFLite Model Maker.
* `robotic_hand.py`: Contains the robotic hand code, including the webcam feed and serial communication interface and the object detection model and robotic hand integration.

**Dependencies**

* TFLite Model Maker library
* Python 3.9
* OpenCV library (for webcam feed processing)
* PySerial library (for serial communication with the robotic hand)
